# Discord Bot Function

This function allows you to implement a simple command-interaction for a Discord bot using Discord Interactions. This bot is able to verify requests and handle them. In its current implementation, it responds to the '/hello' command with a message.

## Environment Variables

To ensure the function operates as intended, ensure the following variables are set:

- **DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY**: This is the public key of your Discord bot. To obtain this, you can visit the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and select your application. Under the 'General Information' tab, you will find the 'Public Key' field.

## Request Verification

The function verifies incoming requests from Discord using the `verifyKey` method. It checks whether the request signature in the header matches the one expected. If the request is not verified, the function will return a 401 error with a message "Invalid request signature".

## Interaction Handling

The function checks if the incoming request is an interaction of the type APPLICATION_COMMAND. If it is, and if the command is '/hello', the function responds with a message, "Hello from Appwrite ðŸ‘‹". If it's not the '/hello' command, the function will respond with a simple acknowledgement (PONG).

## Usage

This function supports the interaction of command type coming from Discord:

1. **Executing the '/hello' command**

   - **Interaction Type:** APPLICATION_COMMAND
   - **Command:** '/hello'
   - **Response:** 
     - On success, the function will respond with "Hello from Appwrite ðŸ‘‹".
     - If the command is not '/hello', the function will respond with a simple acknowledgement (PONG).

## Error Handling

In case of any error during interaction handling, the function will return a 500 error with the message "Failed to process interaction".

Note: The `error` and `log` functions used in this code are part of the Appwrite Cloud Functions SDK and are used to log any errors or general information, respectively. The error logs can be helpful for debugging in case something goes wrong with your function.
