# Stripe Subscriptions Function

This function helps to handle Stripe subscriptions and track them in an Appwrite database. It consists of handling Stripe checkout sessions, webhooks, and managing user subscriptions in a database.

## Environment Variables

To ensure the function operates as intended, ensure the following variables are set:

- **APPWRITE_API_KEY**: This is your Appwrite project's API key.
- **APPWRITE_ENDPOINT**: This is the endpoint where your Appwrite server is located.
- **APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID**: This refers to the specific ID of your Appwrite project.
- **STRIPE_SECRET_KEY**: This is your Stripe Secret key.
- **STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET**: The secret used to validate the Stripe Webhook signature.
- **SUCCESS_URL**: The URL users are redirected to after a successful payment.
- **CANCEL_URL**: The URL users are redirected to after a cancelled payment attempt.

Additionally, the function has the following optional variables:

- **DATABASE_ID**: This is the ID for the database where subscriptions will be stored. If not provided, it defaults to "stripe-subscriptions".
- **COLLECTION_ID**: This is the ID for the collection within the database. If not provided, it defaults to "subscriptions".

## Database Setup

After the installation step, if the specified database doesn't exist, the setup script will automatically create it. It will also create a collection within the database, adding the necessary attributes to the collection.

## Usage

This function supports two primary request paths:

1. **Checkout Session Creation**

   - **Request Path:** /checkout
   - **Request Type:** GET
   - **Response:** 
     - On success, the function will redirect to the Stripe Checkout session URL.
     - If the request fails, the user is redirected to the specified `CANCEL_URL`.

2. **Webhook Handling**

   - **Request Path:** /webhook
   - **Request Type:** POST
   - **Content Type:** application/json
   - **Response:** 
     - The function will respond with an empty response after processing the webhook events.
     - It handles two events:
        1. `customer.subscription.created` - The user is upgraded to a premium subscription.
        2. `customer.subscription.deleted` - The user is downgraded from their premium subscription.

## Setting Up Stripe API

Setting up the Stripe API involves generating the required API keys and setting up the necessary webhook.

1. **API Keys**
    - Log in to your Stripe dashboard.
    - Navigate to Developers > API keys.
    - Here, you can find your publishable key and your secret key. You will need the secret key for this function. Be sure not to share or expose this key as it could allow others to make API requests on behalf of your account.

2. **Webhooks**
    - In your Stripe dashboard, navigate to Developers > Webhooks.
    - Click "+ Add endpoint" and set the URL to where you've hosted this function with the /webhook path, and select the "customer.subscription.created" and "customer.subscription.deleted" events.
    - Once you've created the webhook, you'll be able to view and copy the signing secret (i.e., `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`).

Ensure that you have properly set all the required environment variables for the function to work as intended. Be sure to replace any placeholders with the actual values.
