# URL Shortener Function

This function allows you to turn long URLs into shortened, more manageable URLs. A unique, short, alphanumeric code is generated for each URL and stored in a database collection. The original URL can be accessed later using the short code.

## Environment Variables

To ensure the function operates as intended, ensure the following variables are set:

- **APPWRITE_API_KEY**: This is your Appwrite project's API key.
- **APPWRITE_ENDPOINT**: This is the endpoint where your Appwrite server is located.
- **APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID**: This refers to the specific ID of your Appwrite project.
- **SHORT_DOMAIN**: This is the base domain used when generating the short URLs.

Additionally, the function has the following optional variables:

- **DATABASE_ID**: This is the ID for the database where URLs will be stored. If not provided, it will default to "url-shortener".
- **COLLECTION_ID**: This is the ID for the collection within the database. If not provided, it defaults to "urls".

## Database Setup

If the specified database doesn't exist, the function will automatically create it. It will create a collection within the database and add a URL attribute to the collection.
